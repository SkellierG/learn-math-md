This roadmap is designed to guide you through a constructive and pure theoretical approach to mathematics. Starting with the most abstract foundations and advancing towards more specialized application areas, this journey will help you develop a deep and solid understanding of mathematical concepts.

## 1. [Logic and Foundations](logic-and-foundations/Logic-and-Foundations.md)
- **[Propositional Logic](logic-and-foundations/Propositional-Logic.md)**: Basic concepts of truth, logical connectives, truth tables.
- **[Predicate Logic](logic-and-foundations/Predicate-Logic.md)**: Quantifiers, natural deduction, model theories.
- **[Set Theory](logic-and-foundations/Set-Theory.md)**: Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, operations with sets, cardinality, concepts of infinity.

**Why?**: Starting with logic and set theory provides the conceptual and notational framework necessary for developing abstract thinking in mathematics. These foundations will enable you to understand and build upon more advanced concepts with clarity and rigor.

## 2. [Abstract Algebra](algebra/Algebra.md)
- **[Group Theory](algebra/abstract-algebra/Group-Theory.md)**: Definition of groups, subgroups, homomorphisms, permutation groups.
- **[Ring Theory](algebra/abstract-algebra/Ring-Theory.md)**: Rings, ideals, ring homomorphisms, divisibility in rings.
- **[Field Theory](algebra/abstract-algebra/Field-Theory.md)**: Field extensions, finite fields, polynomials, Galois theory.
- **[Linear Algebra](algebra/linear-algebra/Linear-Algebra.md)**: Vector spaces, linear transformations, matrices, determinants, bilinear forms.

**Why?**: Studying Abstract Algebra establishes the fundamental structures upon which much of modern mathematics is built. Learning about groups, rings, and fields will help you understand advanced concepts and apply algebraic tools in various areas of mathematics and science.

## 3. [Arithmetic and Number Theory](algebra/elementary-algebra/arithmetic/Arithmetic.md)
- **[Arithmetic of Natural and Integer Numbers](algebra/elementary-algebra/arithmetic/Natural-and-Integer-Numbers.md)**: Operations, fundamental properties.
- **[Basic Number Theory](algebra/elementary-algebra/arithmetic/Basic-Number-Theory.md)**: Divisibility, prime numbers, fundamental theorems such as Fermat's Theorem, RSA in cryptography.
- **[Real and Complex Numbers](algebra/elementary-algebra/arithmetic/Real-and-Complex-Numbers.md)**: Construction of real numbers, properties, extension to complex numbers, operations, and properties.

**Why?**: While Abstract Algebra provides a general framework, Arithmetic and Number Theory are essential for understanding the structure of numbers and their applications. These topics form the foundation for many branches of mathematics and have practical applications in areas such as cryptography and number theory.

## 4. [Analysis](analysis/Analysis.md)
- **[Real Analysis](analysis/real-analysis/Real-Analysis.md)**: Sequences and series, limits, continuity, derivatives, fundamental theorems such as Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem and Heine-Borel Theorem.
- **[Complex Analysis](analysis/complex-analysis/Complex-Analysis.md)**: Functions of complex variables, integrals in the complex plane, Cauchyâ€™s Theorems, Laurent series.
- **[Functional Analysis](analysis/functional-analysis/Functional-Analysis.md)**: Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces, linear operators, spectra of operators.

**Why?**: Analysis provides crucial tools for studying functions and their behavior. It is fundamental for many advanced branches of mathematics and has applications in physics, engineering, and other applied sciences.

## 5. [Topology](topology/Topology.md)
- **[General Topology](topology/general-topology/General-Topology.md)**: Topological spaces, continuity, compactness, connectivity.
- **[Algebraic Topology](topology/algebraic-topology/Algebraic-Topology.md)**: Homotopy groups, homology, cohomology.
- **[Differential Topology](topology/differential-topology/Differential-Topology.md)**: Manifolds, differential forms, Stokes' Theorem and Gauss' Theorem.

**Why?**: Topology studies the properties of spaces that are invariant under continuous deformations. It is crucial for understanding the global behavior of functions and the spaces in which these functions reside, which is essential for applications in mathematics and physics.

## 6. [Discrete Mathematics](discrete-mathematics/Discrete-Mathematics.md)
- **[Graph Theory](discrete-mathematics/graph-theory/Graph-Theory.md)**: Definition, properties, directed and undirected graphs, bipartite graphs.
- **[Combinatorics](discrete-mathematics/combinatorics/Combinatorics.md)**: Counting principles, permutations, combinations, inclusion-exclusion principles.
- **[Mathematical Logic and Computation Theory](discrete-mathematics/mathematical-logic-and-computation-theory/Mathematical-Logic-and-Computation-Theory.md)**: Formal languages, automata, theory of computability.

**Why?**: Discrete mathematics is essential for theoretical computer science and other areas where continuity is not a consideration. Graph theory and combinatorics are fundamental for solving problems in computer science and optimization.

## 7. [Applied Mathematics](applied-mathematics/Applied-Mathematics.md) and [Computational Mathematics](computational-mathematics/Computational-Mathematics.md)
- **[Differential Equations](applied-mathematics/differential-equations/Differential-Equations.md)**: Ordinary and partial differential equations, applications in physics.
- **[Numerical Methods](applied-mathematics/numerical-methods/Numerical-Methods.md)**: Interpolation, numerical integration and differentiation methods, solving linear systems.
- **[Cryptography](applied-mathematics/cryptography/Cryptography.md)**: Fundamentals of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, applications of number theory in computer security.

**Why?**: This section connects abstract mathematics with practical applications in physical, computational, and financial sciences. Learning about differential equations, numerical methods, and cryptography will enable you to apply mathematical concepts to real-world problems and advanced technologies.
